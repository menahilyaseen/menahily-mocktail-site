        Though that most definitely does not mean it is not a fun, delicious, and stylish drink. The number of ingredients you can add into your mocktail are endless! 
        Besides the alcohol of course. Take a break from the liquor, see what fabulous drinks you can come up with no matter the day, month, and year. A mocktail is the perfect drink for any time. 
        Take a look through the website and see four drinks that are the best match depending on each of the four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and fall! Each season throughout the year has the ability to make an individual feel a certain way.
